# Snake Game

The objective of this final was to create a project of my own interest and be able to fully and successfully run the project.
I decided to create a snake game where the snake must try to obtain its food so that it can grow longer and longer. The more food eaten, the longer the snake gets, and the less space the snake has to move around the screen.
